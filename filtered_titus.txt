|act||scene|[Rome. Before the Capitol
Flourish. Enter the TRIBUNES and SENATORS aloft; and then enter
below
SATURNINUS and his followers at one door, and BASSIANUS and his
followers
at the other, with drums and trumpets]
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    Noble patricians, patrons of my right,
    Defend the justice of my cause with arms;
    And, countrymen, my loving followers,
    Plead my successive title with your swords.
    I am his first born son that was the last
    That wore the imperial diadem of Rome;
    Then let my father's honours live in me,
    Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.
|speaker|BASSIANUS|lines|    Romans, friends, followers, favourers of my right,
    If ever Bassianus, Caesar's son,
    Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,
    Keep then this passage to the Capitol;
    And suffer not dishonour to approach
    The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate,
    To justice, continence, and nobility;
    But let desert in pure election shine;
    And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.
        [Enter MARCUS ANDRONICUS aloft, with the crown]
|speaker|MARCUS|lines|    Princes, that strive by factions and by friends
    Ambitiously for rule and empery,
    Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand
    A special party, have by common voice
    In election for the Roman empery
    Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius
    For many good and great deserts to Rome.
    A nobler man, a braver warrior,
    Lives not this day within the city walls.
    He by the Senate is accited home,
    From weary wars against the barbarous Goths,
    That with his sons, a terror to our foes,
    Hath yok'd a nation strong, train'd up in arms.
    Ten years are spent since first he undertook
    This cause of Rome, and chastised with arms
    Our enemies' pride; five times he hath return'd
    Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons
    In coffins from the field; and at this day
    To the monument of that Andronici
    Done sacrifice of expiation,
    And slain the noblest prisoner of the Goths.
    And now at last, laden with honour's spoils,
    Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
    Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms.
    Let us entreat, by honour of his name
    Whom worthily you would have now succeed,
    And in the Capitol and Senate's right,
    Whom you pretend to honour and adore,
    That you withdraw you and abate your strength,
    Dismiss your followers, and, as suitors should,
    Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    How fair the Tribune speaks to calm my thoughts.
|speaker|BASSIANUS|lines|    Marcus Andronicus, so I do affy
    In thy uprightness and integrity,
    And so I love and honour thee and thine,
    Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,
    And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,
    Gracious Lavinia, Rome's rich ornament,
    That I will here dismiss my loving friends,
    And to my fortunes and the people's favour
    Commit my cause in balance to be weigh'd.
                                [Exeunt the soldiers of BASSIANUS]
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    Friends, that have been thus forward in my right,
    I thank you all and here dismiss you all,
    And to the love and favour of my country
    Commit myself, my person, and the cause.
                               [Exeunt the soldiers of SATURNINUS]
    Rome, be as just and gracious unto me
    As I am confident and kind to thee.
    Open the gates and let me in.
|speaker|BASSIANUS|lines|    Tribunes, and me, a poor competitor.
                    [Flourish. They go up into the Senate House]
                      [Enter a CAPTAIN]
|speaker|CAPTAIN|lines|    Romans, make way. The good Andronicus,
    Patron of virtue, Rome's best champion,
    Successful in the battles that he fights,
    With honour and with fortune is return'd
    From where he circumscribed with his sword
    And brought to yoke the enemies of Rome.
        [Sound drums and trumpets, and then enter MARTIUS
        and MUTIUS, two of TITUS' sons; and then two men
        bearing a coffin covered with black; then LUCIUS
        and QUINTUS, two other sons; then TITUS ANDRONICUS;
        and then TAMORA the Queen of Goths, with her three
        sons, ALARBUS, DEMETRIUS, and CHIRON, with AARON the
        Moor, and others,  as many as can be. Then set down
        the coffin and TITUS speaks]
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!
    Lo, as the bark that hath discharg'd her fraught
    Returns with precious lading to the bay
    From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage,
    Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,
    To re-salute his country with his tears,
    Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.
    Thou great defender of this Capitol,
    Stand gracious to the rites that we intend!
    Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,
    Half of the number that King Priam had,
    Behold the poor remains, alive and dead!
    These that survive let Rome reward with love;
    These that I bring unto their latest home,
    With burial amongst their ancestors.
    Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.
    Titus, unkind, and careless of thine own,
    Why suffer'st thou thy sons, unburied yet,
    To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?
    Make way to lay them by their brethren.
                                            [They open the tomb]
    There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,
    And sleep in peace, slain in your country's wars.
    O sacred receptacle of my joys,
    Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,
    How many sons hast thou of mine in store
    That thou wilt never render to me more!
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,
    That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile
    Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh
    Before this earthy prison of their bones,
    That so the shadows be not unappeas'd,
    Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    I give him you- the noblest that survives,
    The eldest son of this distressed queen.
|speaker|TAMORA|lines|    Stay, Roman brethen! Gracious conqueror,
    Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed,
    A mother's tears in passion for her son;
    And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,
    O, think my son to be as dear to me!
    Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome
    To beautify thy triumphs, and return
    Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke;
    But must my sons be slaughtered in the streets
    For valiant doings in their country's cause?
    O, if to fight for king and commonweal
    Were piety in thine, it is in these.
    Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood.
    Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?
    Draw near them then in being merciful.
    Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge.
    Thrice-noble Titus, spare my first-born son.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me.
    These are their brethren, whom your Goths beheld
    Alive and dead; and for their brethren slain
    Religiously they ask a sacrifice.
    To this your son is mark'd, and die he must
    T' appease their groaning shadows that are gone.
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    Away with him, and make a fire straight;
    And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,
    Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consum'd.
                                [Exeunt TITUS' SONS, with ALARBUS]
|speaker|TAMORA|lines|    O cruel, irreligious piety!
|speaker|CHIRON|lines|    Was never Scythia half so barbarous!
|speaker|DEMETRIUS|lines|    Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.
    Alarbus goes to rest, and we survive
    To tremble under Titus' threat'ning look.
    Then, madam, stand resolv'd, but hope withal
    The self-same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy
    With opportunity of sharp revenge
    Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent
    May favour Tamora, the Queen of Goths-
    When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen-
    To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.
            Re-enter LUCIUS, QUINTUS, MARTIUS, and
   MUTIUS, the sons of ANDRONICUS, with their swords bloody
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    See, lord and father, how we have perform'd
    Our Roman rites: Alarbus' limbs are lopp'd,
    And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,
    Whose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky.
    Remaineth nought but to inter our brethren,
    And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Let it be so, and let Andronicus
    Make this his latest farewell to their souls.
                 [Sound trumpets and lay the coffin in the tomb]
    In peace and honour rest you here, my sons;
    Rome's readiest champions, repose you here in rest,
    Secure from worldly chances and mishaps!
    Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,
    Here grow no damned grudges, here are no storms,
    No noise, but silence and eternal sleep.
    In peace and honour rest you here, my sons!
                       [Enter LAVINIA]
|speaker|LAVINIA|lines|    In peace and honour live Lord Titus long;
    My noble lord and father, live in fame!
    Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears
    I render for my brethren's obsequies;
    And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy
    Shed on this earth for thy return to Rome.
    O, bless me here with thy victorious hand,
    Whose fortunes Rome's best citizens applaud!
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserv'd
    The cordial of mine age to glad my heart!
    Lavinia, live; outlive thy father's days,
    And fame's eternal date, for virtue's praise!
          [Enter, above, MARCUS ANDRONICUS and TRIBUNES;
          re-enter SATURNINUS, BASSIANUS, and attendants]
|speaker|MARCUS|lines|    Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother,
    Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome!
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Thanks, gentle Tribune, noble brother Marcus.
|speaker|MARCUS|lines|    And welcome, nephews, from successful wars,
    You that survive and you that sleep in fame.
    Fair lords, your fortunes are alike in all
    That in your country's service drew your swords;
    But safer triumph is this funeral pomp
    That hath aspir'd to Solon's happiness
    And triumphs over chance in honour's bed.
    Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome,
    Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,
    Send thee by me, their Tribune and their trust,
    This palliament of white and spotless hue;
    And name thee in election for the empire
    With these our late-deceased Emperor's sons:
    Be candidatus then, and put it on,
    And help to set a head on headless Rome.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    A better head her glorious body fits
    Than his that shakes for age and feebleness.
    What, should I don this robe and trouble you?
    Be chosen with proclamations to-day,
    To-morrow yield up rule, resign my life,
    And set abroach new business for you all?
    Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,
    And led my country's strength successfully,
    And buried one and twenty valiant sons,
    Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms,
    In right and service of their noble country.
    Give me a staff of honour for mine age,
    But not a sceptre to control the world.
    Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
|speaker|MARCUS|lines|    Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery.
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    Proud and ambitious Tribune, canst thou tell?
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Patience, Prince Saturninus.
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    Romans, do me right.
    Patricians, draw your swords, and sheathe them not
    Till Saturninus be Rome's Emperor.
    Andronicus, would thou were shipp'd to hell
    Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good
    That noble-minded Titus means to thee!
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Content thee, Prince; I will restore to thee
    The people's hearts, and wean them from themselves.
|speaker|BASSIANUS|lines|    Andronicus, I do not flatter thee,
    But honour thee, and will do till I die.
    My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends,
    I will most thankful be; and thanks to men
    Of noble minds is honourable meed.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    People of Rome, and people's Tribunes here,
    I ask your voices and your suffrages:
    Will ye bestow them friendly on Andronicus?
|speaker|TRIBUNES|lines|    To gratify the good Andronicus,
    And gratulate his safe return to Rome,
    The people will accept whom he admits.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Tribunes, I thank you; and this suit I make,
    That you create our Emperor's eldest son,
    Lord Saturnine; whose virtues will, I hope,
    Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,
    And ripen justice in this commonweal.
    Then, if you will elect by my advice,
    Crown him, and say 'Long live our Emperor!'
|speaker|MARCUS|lines|    With voices and applause of every sort,
    Patricians and plebeians, we create
    Lord Saturninus Rome's great Emperor;
    And say 'Long live our Emperor Saturnine!'
                           [A long flourish till they come down]
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    Titus Andronicus, for thy favours done
    To us in our election this day
    I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts,
    And will with deeds requite thy gentleness;
    And for an onset, Titus, to advance
    Thy name and honourable family,
    Lavinia will I make my empress,
    Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,
    And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse.
    Tell me, Andronicus, doth this motion please thee?
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    It doth, my worthy lord, and in this match
    I hold me highly honoured of your Grace,
    And here in sight of Rome, to Saturnine,
    King and commander of our commonweal,
    The wide world's Emperor, do I consecrate
    My sword, my chariot, and my prisoners,
    Presents well worthy Rome's imperious lord;
    Receive them then, the tribute that I owe,
    Mine honour's ensigns humbled at thy feet.
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life.
    How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts
    Rome shall record; and when I do forget
    The least of these unspeakable deserts,
    Romans, forget your fealty to me.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|     [To TAMORA]  Now, madam, are you prisoner to an
emperor;
    To him that for your honour and your state
    Will use you nobly and your followers.
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|     [Aside]  A goodly lady, trust me; of the hue
    That I would choose, were I to choose anew.-
    Clear up, fair Queen, that cloudy countenance;
    Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer,
    Thou com'st not to be made a scorn in Rome-
    Princely shall be thy usage every way.
    Rest on my word, and let not discontent
    Daunt all your hopes. Madam, he comforts you
    Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths.
    Lavinia, you are not displeas'd with this?
|speaker|LAVINIA|lines|    Not I, my lord, sith true nobility
    Warrants these words in princely courtesy.
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    Thanks, sweet Lavinia. Romans, let us go.
    Ransomless here we set our prisoners free.
    Proclaim our honours, lords, with trump and drum.
                                                      [Flourish]
|speaker|BASSIANUS|lines|    Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.
                                               [Seizing LAVINIA]
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    How, sir! Are you in earnest then, my lord?
|speaker|BASSIANUS|lines|    Ay, noble Titus, and resolv'd withal
    To do myself this reason and this right.
|speaker|MARCUS|lines|    Suum cuique is our Roman justice:
    This prince in justice seizeth but his own.
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    And that he will and shall, if Lucius live.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Traitors, avaunt! Where is the Emperor's guard?
    Treason, my lord- Lavinia is surpris'd!
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    Surpris'd! By whom?
|speaker|BASSIANUS|lines|    By him that justly may
    Bear his betroth'd from all the world away.
                        [Exeunt BASSIANUS and MARCUS with LAVINIA]
|speaker|MUTIUS|lines|    Brothers, help to convey her hence away,
    And with my sword I'll keep this door safe.
                             [Exeunt LUCIUS, QUINTUS, and MARTIUS]
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Follow, my lord, and I'll soon bring her back.
|speaker|MUTIUS|lines|    My lord, you pass not here.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    What, villain boy!
    Bar'st me my way in Rome?
|speaker|MUTIUS|lines|    Help, Lucius, help!
            [TITUS kills him. During the fray, exeunt SATURNINUS,
                            TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON, and AARON
                      Re-enter Lucius]
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    My lord, you are unjust, and more than so:
    In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Nor thou nor he are any sons of mine;
    My sons would never so dishonour me.
                 [Re-enter aloft the EMPEROR
      with TAMORA and her two Sons, and AARON the Moor]
    Traitor, restore Lavinia to the Emperor.
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    Dead, if you will; but not to be his wife,
    That is another's lawful promis'd love.                 [Exit]
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    No, Titus, no; the Emperor needs her not,
    Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock.
    I'll trust by leisure him that mocks me once;
    Thee never, nor thy traitorous haughty sons,
    Confederates all thus to dishonour me.
    Was there none else in Rome to make a stale
    But Saturnine? Full well, Andronicus,
    Agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine
    That saidst I begg'd the empire at thy hands.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    O monstrous! What reproachful words are these?
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    But go thy ways; go, give that changing piece
    To him that flourish'd for her with his sword.
    A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy;
    One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons,
    To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    These words are razors to my wounded heart.
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    And therefore, lovely Tamora, Queen of Goths,
    That, like the stately Phoebe 'mongst her nymphs,
    Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,
    If thou be pleas'd with this my sudden choice,
    Behold, I choose thee, Tamora, for my bride
    And will create thee Empress of Rome.
    Speak, Queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my choice?
    And here I swear by all the Roman gods-
    Sith priest and holy water are so near,
    And tapers burn so bright, and everything
    In readiness for Hymenaeus stand-
    I will not re-salute the streets of Rome,
    Or climb my palace, till from forth this place
    I lead espous'd my bride along with me.
|speaker|TAMORA|lines|    And here in sight of heaven to Rome I swear,
    If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths,
    She will a handmaid be to his desires,
    A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    Ascend, fair Queen, Pantheon. Lords, accompany
    Your noble Emperor and his lovely bride,
    Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine,
    Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered;
    There shall we consummate our spousal rites.
                                            [Exeunt all but TITUS]
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    I am not bid to wait upon this bride.
  TITUS, when wert thou wont to walk alone,
    Dishonoured thus, and challenged of wrongs?
                      [Re-enter MARCUS,
        and TITUS' SONS, LUCIUS, QUINTUS, and MARTIUS]
|speaker|MARCUS|lines|    O Titus, see, O, see what thou hast done!
    In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    No, foolish Tribune, no; no son of mine-
    Nor thou, nor these, confederates in the deed
    That hath dishonoured all our family;
    Unworthy brother and unworthy sons!
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    But let us give him burial, as becomes;
    Give Mutius burial with our bretheren.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Traitors, away! He rests not in this tomb.
    This monument five hundred years hath stood,
    Which I have sumptuously re-edified;
    Here none but soldiers and Rome's servitors
    Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls.
    Bury him where you can, he comes not here.
|speaker|MARCUS|lines|    My lord, this is impiety in you.
    My nephew Mutius' deeds do plead for him;
    He must be buried with his bretheren.
|speaker|QUINTUS & MARTIUS|lines|    And shall, or him we will accompany.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    'And shall!' What villain was it spake that word?
|speaker|QUINTUS|lines|    He that would vouch it in any place but here.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    What, would you bury him in my despite?
|speaker|MARCUS|lines|    No, noble Titus, but entreat of thee
    To pardon Mutius and to bury him.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Marcus, even thou hast struck upon my crest,
    And with these boys mine honour thou hast wounded.
    My foes I do repute you every one;
    So trouble me no more, but get you gone.
|speaker|MARTIUS|lines|    He is not with himself; let us withdraw.
|speaker|QUINTUS|lines|    Not I, till Mutius' bones be buried.
                                [The BROTHER and the SONS kneel]
|speaker|MARCUS|lines|    Brother, for in that name doth nature plead-
|speaker|QUINTUS|lines|    Father, and in that name doth nature speak-
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Speak thou no more, if all the rest will speed.
|speaker|MARCUS|lines|    Renowned Titus, more than half my soul-
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    Dear father, soul and substance of us all-
|speaker|MARCUS|lines|    Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter
    His noble nephew here in virtue's nest,
    That died in honour and Lavinia's cause.
    Thou art a Roman- be not barbarous.
    The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax,
    That slew himself; and wise Laertes' son
    Did graciously plead for his funerals.
    Let not young Mutius, then, that was thy joy,
    Be barr'd his entrance here.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Rise, Marcus, rise;
    The dismal'st day is this that e'er I saw,
    To be dishonoured by my sons in Rome!
    Well, bury him, and bury me the next.
                                   [They put MUTIUS in the tomb]
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    There lie thy bones, sweet Mutius, with thy friends,
    Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb.
|speaker|ALL|lines|     [Kneeling]  No man shed tears for noble Mutius;
    He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause.
|speaker|MARCUS|lines|    My lord- to step out of these dreary dumps-
    How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths
    Is of a sudden thus advanc'd in Rome?
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    I know not, Marcus, but I know it is-
    Whether by device or no, the heavens can tell.
    Is she not, then, beholding to the man
    That brought her for this high good turn so far?
|speaker|MARCUS|lines|    Yes, and will nobly him remunerate.
           [Flourish. Re-enter the EMPEROR, TAMORA
        and her two SONS, with the MOOR, at one door;]
    at the other door, BASSIANUS and LAVINIA, with others
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    So, Bassianus, you have play'd your prize:
    God give you joy, sir, of your gallant bride!
|speaker|BASSIANUS|lines|    And you of yours, my lord! I say no more,
    Nor wish no less; and so I take my leave.
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    Traitor, if Rome have law or we have power,
    Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape.
|speaker|BASSIANUS|lines|    Rape, call you it, my lord, to seize my own,
    My true betrothed love, and now my wife?
    But let the laws of Rome determine all;
    Meanwhile am I possess'd of that is mine.
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    'Tis good, sir. You are very short with us;
    But if we live we'll be as sharp with you.
|speaker|BASSIANUS|lines|    My lord, what I have done, as best I may,
    Answer I must, and shall do with my life.
    Only thus much I give your Grace to know:
    By all the duties that I owe to Rome,
    This noble gentleman, Lord Titus here,
    Is in opinion and in honour wrong'd,
    That, in the rescue of Lavinia,
    With his own hand did slay his youngest son,
    In zeal to you, and highly mov'd to wrath
    To be controll'd in that he frankly gave.
    Receive him then to favour, Saturnine,
    That hath express'd himself in all his deeds
    A father and a friend to thee and Rome.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Prince Bassianus, leave to plead my deeds.
    'Tis thou and those that have dishonoured me.
    Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge
    How I have lov'd and honoured Saturnine!
|speaker|TAMORA|lines|    My worthy lord, if ever Tamora
    Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine,
    Then hear me speak indifferently for all;
    And at my suit, sweet, pardon what is past.
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    What, madam! be dishonoured openly,
    And basely put it up without revenge?
|speaker|TAMORA|lines|    Not so, my lord; the gods of Rome forfend
    I should be author to dishonour you!
    But on mine honour dare I undertake
    For good Lord Titus' innocence in all,
    Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs.
    Then at my suit look graciously on him;
    Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose,
    Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart.
    [Aside to SATURNINUS]  My lord, be rul'd by me,
      be won at last;
    Dissemble all your griefs and discontents.
    You are but newly planted in your throne;
    Lest, then, the people, and patricians too,
    Upon a just survey take Titus' part,
    And so supplant you for ingratitude,
    Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin,
    Yield at entreats, and then let me alone:
    I'll find a day to massacre them all,
    And raze their faction and their family,
    The cruel father and his traitorous sons,
    To whom I sued for my dear son's life;
    And make them know what 'tis to let a queen
    Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain.-
    Come, come, sweet Emperor; come, Andronicus.
    Take up this good old man, and cheer the heart
    That dies in tempest of thy angry frown.
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    Rise, Titus, rise; my Empress hath prevail'd.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    I thank your Majesty and her, my lord;
    These words, these looks, infuse new life in me.
|speaker|TAMORA|lines|    Titus, I am incorporate in Rome,
    A Roman now adopted happily,
    And must advise the Emperor for his good.
    This day all quarrels die, Andronicus;
    And let it be mine honour, good my lord,
    That I have reconcil'd your friends and you.
    For you, Prince Bassianus, I have pass'd
    My word and promise to the Emperor
    That you will be more mild and tractable.
    And fear not, lords- and you, Lavinia.
    By my advice, all humbled on your knees,
    You shall ask pardon of his Majesty.
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    We do, and vow to heaven and to his Highness
    That what we did was mildly as we might,
    Tend'ring our sister's honour and our own.
|speaker|MARCUS|lines|    That on mine honour here do I protest.
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    Away, and talk not; trouble us no more.
|speaker|TAMORA|lines|    Nay, nay, sweet Emperor, we must all be friends.
    The Tribune and his nephews kneel for grace.
    I will not be denied. Sweet heart, look back.
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    Marcus, for thy sake, and thy brother's here,
    And at my lovely Tamora's entreats,
    I do remit these young men's heinous faults.
    Stand up.
    Lavinia, though you left me like a churl,
    I found a friend; and sure as death I swore
    I would not part a bachelor from the priest.
    Come, if the Emperor's court can feast two brides,
    You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends.
    This day shall be a love-day, Tamora.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    To-morrow, and it please your Majesty
    To hunt the panther and the hart with me,
    With horn and hound we'll give your Grace bonjour.
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    Be it so, Titus, and gramercy too.
                                          [Exeunt. Sound trumpets]
|act||scene|[Plains near Rome
Enter LUCIUS with an army of GOTHS with drums and colours]
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    Approved warriors and my faithful friends,
    I have received letters from great Rome
    Which signifies what hate they bear their Emperor
    And how desirous of our sight they are.
    Therefore, great lords, be, as your titles witness,
    Imperious and impatient of your wrongs;
    And wherein Rome hath done you any scath,
    Let him make treble satisfaction.
|speaker|FIRST GOTH|lines|    Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus,
    Whose name was once our terror, now our comfort,
    Whose high exploits and honourable deeds
    Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt,
    Be bold in us: we'll follow where thou lead'st,
    Like stinging bees in hottest summer's day,
    Led by their master to the flow'red fields,
    And be aveng'd on cursed Tamora.
|speaker|ALL THE GOTHS|lines|    And as he saith, so say we all with him.
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.
    But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?
     Enter a GOTH, leading AARON with his CHILD in his arms
|speaker|SECOND GOTH|lines|    Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray'd
    To gaze upon a ruinous monastery;
    And as I earnestly did fix mine eye
    Upon the wasted building, suddenly
    I heard a child cry underneath a wall.
    I made unto the noise, when soon I heard
    The crying babe controll'd with this discourse:
    'Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!
    Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,
    Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,
    Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor;
    But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,
    They never do beget a coal-black calf.
    Peace, villain, peace!'- even thus he rates the babe-
    'For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth,
    Who, when he knows thou art the Empress' babe,
    Will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake.'
    With this, my weapon drawn, I rush'd upon him,
    Surpris'd him suddenly, and brought him hither
    To use as you think needful of the man.
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil
    That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand;
    This is the pearl that pleas'd your Empress' eye;
    And here's the base fruit of her burning lust.
    Say, wall-ey'd slave, whither wouldst thou convey
    This growing image of thy fiend-like face?
    Why dost not speak? What, deaf? Not a word?
    A halter, soldiers! Hang him on this tree,
    And by his side his fruit of bastardy.
|speaker|AARON|lines|    Touch not the boy, he is of royal blood.
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    Too like the sire for ever being good.
    First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl-
    A sight to vex the father's soul withal.
    Get me a ladder.
                [A ladder brought, which AARON is made to climb]
|speaker|AARON|lines|    Lucius, save the child,
    And bear it from me to the Empress.
    If thou do this, I'll show thee wondrous things
    That highly may advantage thee to hear;
    If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,
    I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all!'
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    Say on; an if it please me which thou speak'st,
    Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish'd.
|speaker|AARON|lines|    An if it please thee! Why, assure thee, Lucius,
    'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;
    For I must talk of murders, rapes, and massacres,
    Acts of black night, abominable deeds,
    Complots of mischief, treason, villainies,
    Ruthful to hear, yet piteously perform'd;
    And this shall all be buried in my death,
    Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.
|speaker|AARON|lines|    Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    Who should I swear by? Thou believest no god;
    That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?
|speaker|AARON|lines|    What if I do not? as indeed I do not;
    Yet, for I know thou art religious
    And hast a thing within thee called conscience,
    With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies
    Which I have seen thee careful to observe,
    Therefore I urge thy oath. For that I know
    An idiot holds his bauble for a god,
    And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,
    To that I'll urge him. Therefore thou shalt vow
    By that same god- what god soe'er it be
    That thou adorest and hast in reverence-
    To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up;
    Or else I will discover nought to thee.
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    Even by my god I swear to thee I will.
|speaker|AARON|lines|    First know thou, I begot him on the Empress.
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    O most insatiate and luxurious woman!
|speaker|AARON|lines|    Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity
    To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.
    'Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus;
    They cut thy sister's tongue, and ravish'd her,
    And cut her hands, and trimm'd her as thou sawest.
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    O detestable villain! Call'st thou that trimming?
|speaker|AARON|lines|    Why, she was wash'd, and cut, and trimm'd, and 'twas
    Trim sport for them which had the doing of it.
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    O barbarous beastly villains like thyself!
|speaker|AARON|lines|    Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them.
    That codding spirit had they from their mother,
    As sure a card as ever won the set;
    That bloody mind, I think, they learn'd of me,
    As true a dog as ever fought at head.
    Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.
    I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole
    Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay;
    I wrote the letter that thy father found,
    And hid the gold within that letter mention'd,
    Confederate with the Queen and her two sons;
    And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,
    Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?
    I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand,
    And, when I had it, drew myself apart
    And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter.
    I pried me through the crevice of a wall,
    When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads;
    Beheld his tears, and laugh'd so heartily
    That both mine eyes were rainy like to his;
    And when I told the Empress of this sport,
    She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,
    And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.
|speaker|GOTH|lines|    What, canst thou say all this and never blush?
|speaker|AARON|lines|    Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?
|speaker|AARON|lines|    Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.
    Even now I curse the day- and yet, I think,
    Few come within the compass of my curse-
    Wherein I did not some notorious ill;
    As kill a man, or else devise his death;
    Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it;
    Accuse some innocent, and forswear myself;
    Set deadly enmity between two friends;
    Make poor men's cattle break their necks;
    Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,
    And bid the owners quench them with their tears.
    Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,
    And set them upright at their dear friends' door
    Even when their sorrows almost was forgot,
    And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,
    Have with my knife carved in Roman letters
    'Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.'
    Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things
    As willingly as one would kill a fly;
    And nothing grieves me heartily indeed
    But that I cannot do ten thousand more.
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    Bring down the devil, for he must not die
    So sweet a death as hanging presently.
|speaker|AARON|lines|    If there be devils, would I were a devil,
    To live and burn in everlasting fire,
    So I might have your company in hell
    But to torment you with my bitter tongue!
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.
                       [Enter AEMILIUS]
|speaker|GOTH|lines|    My lord, there is a messenger from Rome
    Desires to be admitted to your presence.
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    Let him come near.
    Welcome, Aemilius. What's the news from Rome?
|speaker|AEMILIUS|lines|    Lord Lucius, and you Princes of the Goths,
    The Roman Emperor greets you all by me;
    And, for he understands you are in arms,
    He craves a parley at your father's house,
    Willing you to demand your hostages,
    And they shall be immediately deliver'd.
|speaker|FIRST GOTH|lines|    What says our general?
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    Aemilius, let the Emperor give his pledges
    Unto my father and my uncle Marcus.
    And we will come. March away.                         [Exeunt]
|scene|[Rome. Before TITUS' house
Enter TAMORA, and her two sons, DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, disguised]
|speaker|TAMORA|lines|    Thus, in this strange and sad habiliment,
    I will encounter with Andronicus,
    And say I am Revenge, sent from below
    To join with him and right his heinous wrongs.
    Knock at his study, where they say he keeps
    To ruminate strange plots of dire revenge;
    Tell him Revenge is come to join with him,
    And work confusion on his enemies.
         [They knock and TITUS opens his study door, above]
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Who doth molest my contemplation?
    Is it your trick to make me ope the door,
    That so my sad decrees may fly away
    And all my study be to no effect?
    You are deceiv'd; for what I mean to do
    See here in bloody lines I have set down;
    And what is written shall be executed.
|speaker|TAMORA|lines|    Titus, I am come to talk with thee.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    No, not a word. How can I grace my talk,
    Wanting a hand to give it that accord?
    Thou hast the odds of me; therefore no more.
|speaker|TAMORA|lines|    If thou didst know me, thou wouldst talk with me.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    I am not mad, I know thee well enough:
    Witness this wretched stump, witness these crimson lines;
    Witness these trenches made by grief and care;
    Witness the tiring day and heavy night;
    Witness all sorrow that I know thee well
    For our proud Empress, mighty Tamora.
    Is not thy coming for my other hand?
|speaker|TAMORA|lines|    Know thou, sad man, I am not Tamora:
    She is thy enemy and I thy friend.
    I am Revenge, sent from th' infernal kingdom
    To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind
    By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes.
    Come down and welcome me to this world's light;
    Confer with me of murder and of death;
    There's not a hollow cave or lurking-place,
    No vast obscurity or misty vale,
    Where bloody murder or detested rape
    Can couch for fear but I will find them out;
    And in their ears tell them my dreadful name-
    Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Art thou Revenge? and art thou sent to me
    To be a torment to mine enemies?
|speaker|TAMORA|lines|    I am; therefore come down and welcome me.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Do me some service ere I come to thee.
    Lo, by thy side where Rape and Murder stands;
    Now give some surance that thou art Revenge-
    Stab them, or tear them on thy chariot wheels;
    And then I'll come and be thy waggoner
    And whirl along with thee about the globes.
    Provide thee two proper palfreys, black as jet,
    To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away,
    And find out murderers in their guilty caves;
    And when thy car is loaden with their heads,
    I will dismount, and by thy waggon wheel
    Trot, like a servile footman, all day long,
    Even from Hyperion's rising in the east
    Until his very downfall in the sea.
    And day by day I'll do this heavy task,
    So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there.
|speaker|TAMORA|lines|    These are my ministers, and come with me.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Are they thy ministers? What are they call'd?
|speaker|TAMORA|lines|    Rape and Murder; therefore called so
    'Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Good Lord, how like the Empress' sons they are!
    And you the Empress! But we worldly men
    Have miserable, mad, mistaking eyes.
    O sweet Revenge, now do I come to thee;
    And, if one arm's embracement will content thee,
    I will embrace thee in it by and by.
|speaker|TAMORA|lines|    This closing with him fits his lunacy.
    Whate'er I forge to feed his brain-sick humours,
    Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,
    For now he firmly takes me for Revenge;
    And, being credulous in this mad thought,
    I'll make him send for Lucius his son,
    And whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,
    I'll find some cunning practice out of hand
    To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,
    Or, at the least, make them his enemies.
    See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme.
                 [Enter TITUS, below]
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Long have I been forlorn, and all for thee.
    Welcome, dread Fury, to my woeful house.
    Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too.
    How like the Empress and her sons you are!
    Well are you fitted, had you but a Moor.
    Could not all hell afford you such a devil?
    For well I wot the Empress never wags
    But in her company there is a Moor;
    And, would you represent our queen aright,
    It were convenient you had such a devil.
    But welcome as you are. What shall we do?
|speaker|TAMORA|lines|    What wouldst thou have us do, Andronicus?
|speaker|DEMETRIUS|lines|    Show me a murderer, I'll deal with him.
|speaker|CHIRON|lines|    Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
    And I am sent to be reveng'd on him.
|speaker|TAMORA|lines|    Show me a thousand that hath done thee wrong,
    And I will be revenged on them all.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Look round about the wicked streets of Rome,
    And when thou find'st a man that's like thyself,
    Good Murder, stab him; he's a murderer.
    Go thou with him, and when it is thy hap
    To find another that is like to thee,
    Good Rapine, stab him; he is a ravisher.
    Go thou with them; and in the Emperor's court
    There is a queen, attended by a Moor;
    Well shalt thou know her by thine own proportion,
    For up and down she doth resemble thee.
    I pray thee, do on them some violent death;
    They have been violent to me and mine.
|speaker|TAMORA|lines|    Well hast thou lesson'd us; this shall we do.
    But would it please thee, good Andronicus,
    To send for Lucius, thy thrice-valiant son,
    Who leads towards Rome a band of warlike Goths,
    And bid him come and banquet at thy house;
    When he is here, even at thy solemn feast,
    I will bring in the Empress and her sons,
    The Emperor himself, and all thy foes;
    And at thy mercy shall they stoop and kneel,
    And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart.
    What says Andronicus to this device?
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Marcus, my brother! 'Tis sad Titus calls.
                  [Enter MARCUS]
    Go, gentle Marcus, to thy nephew Lucius;
    Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths.
    Bid him repair to me, and bring with him
    Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths;
    Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are.
    Tell him the Emperor and the Empress too
    Feast at my house, and he shall feast with them.
    This do thou for my love; and so let him,
    As he regards his aged father's life.
|speaker|MARCUS|lines|    This will I do, and soon return again.            [Exit]
|speaker|TAMORA|lines|    Now will I hence about thy business,
    And take my ministers along with me.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me,
    Or else I'll call my brother back again,
    And cleave to no revenge but Lucius.
|speaker|TAMORA|lines|     [Aside to her sons]  What say you, boys? Will you
abide
      with him,
    Whiles I go tell my lord the Emperor
    How I have govern'd our determin'd jest?
    Yield to his humour, smooth and speak him fair,
    And tarry with him till I turn again.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|     [Aside]  I knew them all, though they suppos'd me mad,
    And will o'er reach them in their own devices,
    A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam.
|speaker|DEMETRIUS|lines|    Madam, depart at pleasure; leave us here.
|speaker|TAMORA|lines|    Farewell, Andronicus, Revenge now goes
    To lay a complot to betray thy foes.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    I know thou dost; and, sweet Revenge, farewell.

|speaker|PUBLIUS|lines|    What is your will?
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Know you these two?
|speaker|PUBLIUS|lines|    The Empress' sons, I take them: Chiron, Demetrius.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Fie, Publius, fie! thou art too much deceiv'd.
    The one is Murder, and Rape is the other's name;
    And therefore bind them, gentle Publius-
    Caius and Valentine, lay hands on them.
    Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour,
    And now I find it; therefore bind them sure,
    And stop their mouths if they begin to cry.             [Exit
                         [They lay hold on CHIRON and DEMETRIUS]]
|speaker|CHIRON|lines|    Villains, forbear! we are the Empress' sons.
|speaker|PUBLIUS|lines|    And therefore do we what we are commanded.
    Stop close their mouths, let them not speak a word.
    Is he sure bound? Look that you bind them fast.
               [Re-enter TITUS ANDRONICUS
        with a knife, and LAVINIA, with a basin]
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Come, come, Lavinia; look, thy foes are bound.
    Sirs, stop their mouths, let them not speak to me;
    But let them hear what fearful words I utter.
    O villains, Chiron and Demetrius!
    Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud;
    This goodly summer with your winter mix'd.
    You kill'd her husband; and for that vile fault
    Two of her brothers were condemn'd to death,
    My hand cut off and made a merry jest;
    Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear
    Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity,
    Inhuman traitors, you constrain'd and forc'd.
    What would you say, if I should let you speak?
    Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
    Hark, wretches! how I mean to martyr you.
    This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,
    Whiles that Lavinia 'tween her stumps doth hold
    The basin that receives your guilty blood.
    You know your mother means to feast with me,
    And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad.
    Hark, villains! I will grind your bones to dust,
    And with your blood and it I'll make a paste;
    And of the paste a coffin I will rear,
    And make two pasties of your shameful heads;
    And bid that strumpet, your unhallowed dam,
    Like to the earth, swallow her own increase.
    This is the feast that I have bid her to,
    And this the banquet she shall surfeit on;
    For worse than Philomel you us'd my daughter,
    And worse than Progne I will be reveng'd.
    And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come,
    Receive the blood; and when that they are dead,
    Let me go grind their bones to powder small,
    And with this hateful liquor temper it;
    And in that paste let their vile heads be bak'd.
    Come, come, be every one officious
    To make this banquet, which I wish may prove
    More stern and bloody than the Centaurs' feast.
                                         [He cuts their throats]
    So.
    Now bring them in, for I will play the cook,
    And see them ready against their mother comes.
                                 [Exeunt, bearing the dead bodies]
|scene|[The court of TITUS' house
Enter Lucius, MARCUS, and the GOTHS, with AARON prisoner,
and his CHILD in the arms of an attendant]
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    Uncle Marcus, since 'tis my father's mind
    That I repair to Rome, I am content.
|speaker|FIRST GOTH|lines|    And ours with thine, befall what fortune will.
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    Good uncle, take you in this barbarous Moor,
    This ravenous tiger, this accursed devil;
    Let him receive no sust'nance, fetter him,
    Till he be brought unto the Empress' face
    For testimony of her foul proceedings.
    And see the ambush of our friends be strong;
    I fear the Emperor means no good to us.
|speaker|AARON|lines|    Some devil whisper curses in my ear,
    And prompt me that my tongue may utter forth
    The venomous malice of my swelling heart!
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    Away, inhuman dog, unhallowed slave!
    Sirs, help our uncle to convey him in.
                        [Exeunt GOTHS with AARON. Flourish within]
    The trumpets show the Emperor is at hand.
            [Sound trumpets. Enter SATURNINUS and]
    TAMORA, with AEMILIUS, TRIBUNES, SENATORS, and others
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    What, hath the firmament more suns than one?
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    What boots it thee to call thyself a sun?
|speaker|MARCUS|lines|    Rome's Emperor, and nephew, break the parle;
    These quarrels must be quietly debated.
    The feast is ready which the careful Titus
    Hath ordain'd to an honourable end,
    For peace, for love, for league, and good to Rome.
    Please you, therefore, draw nigh and take your places.
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    Marcus, we will.
                      [A table brought in. The company sit down]
               Trumpets sounding, enter TITUS
         like a cook, placing the dishes, and LAVINIA
   with a veil over her face; also YOUNG LUCIUS, and others
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Welcome, my lord; welcome, dread Queen;
    Welcome, ye warlike Goths; welcome, Lucius;
    And welcome all. Although the cheer be poor,
    'Twill fill your stomachs; please you eat of it.
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    Why art thou thus attir'd, Andronicus?
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Because I would be sure to have all well
    To entertain your Highness and your Empress.
|speaker|TAMORA|lines|    We are beholding to you, good Andronicus.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    An if your Highness knew my heart, you were.
    My lord the Emperor, resolve me this:
    Was it well done of rash Virginius
    To slay his daughter with his own right hand,
    Because she was enforc'd, stain'd, and deflower'd?
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    It was, Andronicus.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Your reason, mighty lord.
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    Because the girl should not survive her shame,
    And by her presence still renew his sorrows.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    A reason mighty, strong, and effectual;
    A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant
    For me, most wretched, to perform the like.
    Die, die, Lavinia, and thy shame with thee;   [He kills her]
    And with thy shame thy father's sorrow die!
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Kill'd her for whom my tears have made me blind.
    I am as woeful as Virginius was,
    And have a thousand times more cause than he
    To do this outrage; and it now is done.
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    What, was she ravish'd? Tell who did the deed.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Will't please you eat?  Will't please your Highness
feed?
|speaker|TAMORA|lines|    Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Not I; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius.
    They ravish'd her, and cut away her tongue;
    And they, 'twas they, that did her all this wrong.
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    Go, fetch them hither to us presently.
|speaker|TITUS|lines|    Why, there they are, both baked in this pie,
    Whereof their mother daintily hath fed,
    Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
    'Tis true, 'tis true: witness my knife's sharp point.
                                          [He stabs the EMPRESS]
|speaker|SATURNINUS|lines|    Die, frantic wretch, for this accursed deed!
                                                [He stabs TITUS]
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?
    There's meed for meed, death for a deadly deed.
                   [He stabs SATURNINUS. A great tumult. LUCIUS,
               [MARCUS, and their friends go up into the balcony]]
|speaker|MARCUS|lines|    You sad-fac'd men, people and sons of Rome,
    By uproars sever'd, as a flight of fowl
    Scatter'd by winds and high tempestuous gusts?
    O, let me teach you how to knit again
    This scattered corn into one mutual sheaf,
    These broken limbs again into one body;
    Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,
    And she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to,
    Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,
    Do shameful execution on herself.
    But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,
    Grave witnesses of true experience,
    Cannot induce you to attend my words,
    [To Lucius]  Speak, Rome's dear friend, as erst our ancestor,
    When with his solemn tongue he did discourse
    To love-sick Dido's sad attending ear
    The story of that baleful burning night,
    When subtle Greeks surpris'd King Priam's Troy.
    Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch'd our ears,
    Or who hath brought the fatal engine in
    That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.
    My heart is not compact of flint nor steel;
    Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,
    But floods of tears will drown my oratory
    And break my utt'rance, even in the time
    When it should move ye to attend me most,
    And force you to commiseration.
    Here's Rome's young Captain, let him tell the tale;
    While I stand by and weep to hear him speak.
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    Then, gracious auditory, be it known to you
    That Chiron and the damn'd Demetrius
    Were they that murd'red our Emperor's brother;
    And they it were that ravished our sister.
    For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded,
    Our father's tears despis'd, and basely cozen'd
    Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out
    And sent her enemies unto the grave.
    Lastly, myself unkindly banished,
    The gates shut on me, and turn'd weeping out,
    To beg relief among Rome's enemies;
    Who drown'd their enmity in my true tears,
    And op'd their arms to embrace me as a friend.
    I am the turned forth, be it known to you,
    That have preserv'd her welfare in my blood
    And from her bosom took the enemy's point,
    Sheathing the steel in my advent'rous body.
    Alas! you know I am no vaunter, I;
    My scars can witness, dumb although they are,
    That my report is just and full of truth.
    But, soft! methinks I do digress too much,
    Citing my worthless praise. O, pardon me!
    For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.
|speaker|MARCUS|lines|    Now is my turn to speak. Behold the child.
                  [Pointing to the CHILD in an attendant's arms]
    Of this was Tamora delivered,
    The issue of an irreligious Moor,
    Chief architect and plotter of these woes.
    The villain is alive in Titus' house,
    Damn'd as he is, to witness this is true.
    Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge
    These wrongs unspeakable, past patience,
    Or more than any living man could bear.
    Now have you heard the truth: what say you, Romans?
    Have we done aught amiss, show us wherein,
    And, from the place where you behold us pleading,
    The poor remainder of Andronici
    Will, hand in hand, all headlong hurl ourselves,
    And on the ragged stones beat forth our souls,
    And make a mutual closure of our house.
    Speak, Romans, speak; and if you say we shall,
    Lo, hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall.
|speaker|AEMILIUS|lines|    Come, come, thou reverend man of Rome,
    And bring our Emperor gently in thy hand,
    Lucius our Emperor; for well I know
    The common voice do cry it shall be so.
|speaker|ALL|lines|    Lucius, all hail, Rome's royal Emperor!
|speaker|MARCUS|lines|    Go, go into old Titus' sorrowful house,
    And hither hale that misbelieving Moor
    To be adjudg'd some direful slaught'ring death,
    As punishment for his most wicked life.          [Exeunt some
              attendants. LUCIUS, MARCUS, and the others descend]
|speaker|ALL|lines|    Lucius, all hail, Rome's gracious governor!
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    Thanks, gentle Romans! May I govern so
    To heal Rome's harms and wipe away her woe!
    But, gentle people, give me aim awhile,
    For nature puts me to a heavy task.
    Stand all aloof; but, uncle, draw you near
    To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.
    O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips.  [Kisses TITUS]
    These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stain'd face,
    The last true duties of thy noble son!
|speaker|MARCUS|lines|    Tear for tear and loving kiss for kiss
    Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips.
    O, were the sum of these that I should pay
    Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them!
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    Come hither, boy; come, come, come, and learn of us
    To melt in showers. Thy grandsire lov'd thee well;
    Many a time he danc'd thee on his knee,
    Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow;
    Many a story hath he told to thee,
    And bid thee bear his pretty tales in mind
    And talk of them when he was dead and gone.
|speaker|MARCUS|lines|    How many thousand times hath these poor lips,
    When they were living, warm'd themselves on thine!
    O, now, sweet boy, give them their latest kiss!
    Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave;
    Do them that kindness, and take leave of them.
|speaker|BOY|lines|    O grandsire, grandsire! ev'n with all my heart
    Would I were dead, so you did live again!
    O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping;
    My tears will choke me, if I ope my mouth.
            [Re-enter attendants with AARON]
|speaker|A ROMAN|lines|    You sad Andronici, have done with woes;
    Give sentence on the execrable wretch
    That hath been breeder of these dire events.
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    Set him breast-deep in earth, and famish him;
    There let him stand and rave and cry for food.
    If any one relieves or pities him,
    For the offence he dies. This is our doom.
    Some stay to see him fast'ned in the earth.
|speaker|AARON|lines|    Ah, why should wrath be mute and fury dumb?
    I am no baby, I, that with base prayers
    I should repent the evils I have done;
    Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did
    Would I perform, if I might have my will.
    If one good deed in all my life I did,
    I do repent it from my very soul.
|speaker|LUCIUS|lines|    Some loving friends convey the Emperor hence,
    And give him burial in his father's grave.
    My father and Lavinia shall forthwith
    Be closed in our household's monument.
    As for that ravenous tiger, Tamora,
    No funeral rite, nor man in mourning weed,
    No mournful bell shall ring her burial;
    But throw her forth to beasts and birds to prey.
    Her life was beastly and devoid of pity,
    And being dead, let birds on her take pity.           [Exeunt]
